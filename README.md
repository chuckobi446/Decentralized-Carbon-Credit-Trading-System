# Decentralized Carbon Credit Trading System

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, efficient, and verifiable carbon credit issuance, trading, and retirement.

## Overview

The Decentralized Carbon Credit Trading System revolutionizes how carbon credits are created, traded, and retired by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency, reduce intermediaries, and create a more efficient marketplace. The system enables verifiable carbon reduction projects to generate tokenized carbon credits that can be traded globally and ultimately retired to offset carbon footprints.

## Core Components

### Carbon Credit Issuance Contract

Manages the creation and validation of carbon credits:
- Verifies carbon reduction achievements through trusted data oracles
- Issues standardized tokenized carbon credits based on verified reductions
- Maintains immutable records of credit origins and methodologies
- Supports various carbon reduction project types (renewable energy, reforestation, etc.)
- Implements compliance with international carbon accounting standards

### Credit Trading Contract

Facilitates the exchange of carbon credits between participants:
- Provides a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling credits
- Supports both direct peer-to-peer transfers and auction mechanisms
- Implements transparent pricing and market discovery
- Records complete transaction history and ownership changes
- Ensures regulatory compliance across jurisdictions

### Project Verification Contract

Ensures the legitimacy and impact of carbon reduction initiatives:
- Manages the onboarding and validation of new projects
- Stores verification methodologies and measurement processes
- Tracks ongoing monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) activities
- Coordinates with third-party verifiers and certification bodies
- Implements dispute resolution mechanisms for contested projects

### Retirement Contract

Handles the permanent removal of carbon credits from circulation:
- Processes the retirement of credits for offsetting purposes
- Generates verifiable proof of retirement for compliance reporting
- Prevents double-counting or reuse of retired credits
- Provides transparent retirement certificates for end users
- Maintains a public registry of retired credits and associated claims

## Technical Architecture

The system is built on a blockchain infrastructure that ensures:
- Immutable record-keeping of all transactions and actions
- Transparent verification processes visible to all participants
- Interoperability with existing carbon markets and standards
- Scalability to accommodate global carbon trading volumes
- Privacy options for sensitive commercial information

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Access to Ethereum network (Mainnet or supported testnet)
- Node.js and npm (for development)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/carbon-credit-system.git
   cd carbon-credit-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Deploy contracts
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Carbon Reduction Project
```javascript
// Example code for project developers
const projectId = await projectVerificationContract.registerProject(
  projectDetails,
  methodologyId,
  geolocation,
  estimatedReductions,
  monitoringPlan
);
```

### Issuing Carbon Credits
```javascript
// Example code for verified projects
const creditBatch = await carbonCreditIssuanceContract.issueCredits(
  projectId,
  verificationReport,
  quantityInTonnes,
  vintagePeriod
);
```

### Trading Carbon Credits
```javascript
// Example code for marketplace participants
await creditTradingContract.listCredits(
  creditBatchId,
  pricePerCredit,
  quantity,
  expirationDate
);

await creditTradingContract.purchaseCredits(
  listingId,
  quantity,
  { value: totalPayment }
);
```

### Retiring Carbon Credits
```javascript
// Example code for end users offsetting their emissions
const retirementCertificate = await retirementContract.retireCredits(
  creditBatchId,
  quantity,
  beneficiaryName,
  retirementReason
);
```

## Integration Options

- APIs for connecting with existing carbon registries and markets
- SDKs for corporate carbon accounting systems
- Reporting tools for ESG compliance
- Data connectors for environmental monitoring systems
- Mobile verification applications for field auditors

## Benefits
